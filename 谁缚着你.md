### Who is binding you

有沙弥道信，年始十四，来礼师曰：“愿和尚慈悲，乞与解脱法门。”师曰：“谁缚汝？”曰：“无人缚。”师曰： “何更求解脱乎？”信于言下大悟。

A monk Daoxin, 14 years old, asked his master: “Master, how can I be free?”
The master said: “Who is binding you?”
Daoxin said: “No one tied me.”
The master said: “No one is binding you, you are free.”
Daoxin suddenly understood.
