## Eat hungry
Zen Master Lingyou was preaching at the temple, the temple accountant was knocking on the wooden fish, and the chef suddenly clapped his hands and laughed. Zen Master Lingyou asked: “What are you doing?” The chef said, “I am hungry without eating, so I am happy.” Lingyou nodded.
Eat hungry, such a simple reason is worth so happy? Yes, eat when you are hungry. Do not think too much

沩山灵祐禅师——师在法堂坐，库头击木鱼，火头掷却火抄，拊掌大笑。师曰：“众中也有恁么人（意为有悟道的人）。”遂唤来问：“你作么生？”火头曰：“某甲不吃粥肚饥，所以欢喜。”师乃点头。（五灯会元卷九）

灵佑禅师正在寺庙讲道，寺庙会计正敲着木鱼，厨师突然拍手大笑。灵佑禅师问：“你做什么”，厨师说：“不吃饭肚子饿，所以高兴”，灵佑点了点头。
饿了吃饭,这么简单的道理值得这么高兴?是的，肚子饿了就吃饭。不要想太多
