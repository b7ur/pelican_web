• 初住庵时，有尼名实际来，戴笠子，执锡，绕师三匝，曰：“道得即下笠子。”如是三问，师皆无对。尼便去，师曰：“日势稍晚，何不且住？”尼曰：“道得即住。”师又无对。尼去后，师叹曰：“我虽处丈夫之形，而无丈夫之气，不如弃庵，往诸方参寻知识去。”其夜山神告曰： “不须离此，将有肉身菩萨来为和尚说法也。”逾旬，果天龙和尚到庵。师乃迎礼，具陈前事。龙竖一指示之，师当下大悟。 自此凡有学者参问，师唯举一指，无别提倡。有一供过童子，每见人问事，亦竖指祗对。人谓师曰：“和尚！ 童子亦会佛法，凡有问皆如和尚竖指。”师一日潜袖刀子，问童曰：“闻你会佛法，是否？”童曰：“是。”师曰：“如何是佛？”童竖起指头。师以刀断其指，童叫唤走出。师召童子，童回首。师曰：“如何是佛？”童举手不见指头，豁然大悟。
